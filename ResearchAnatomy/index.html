<hr><h2 style="text-align:center; color: navy">Research Anatomy</h2><hr>

    <p>When applying to graduate school, I had my share of frustrating experiences looking at the websites of potential advisors which touted their research interests in technical jargon but did nothing to inform me what they actually did on a daily basis. To remedy this, I will now try to unpack what constitutes my research.</p>

    <div style="text-align:center; color:navy;">
        <h3>Molecular Orbitals</h3></div>
    
    <p>Molecular orbitals are the building blocks of molecular physics and quantum chemistry. Anyone who has taken high school chemistry has probably heard the word "orbital." In nontechnical usage, this word refers to the fact that unlike <a href="https://www.sciencefacts.net/atom-2.html">the conventional illustration</a>, electrons do not orbit around atomic nuclei; their behavior is more complicated.
    anyone who has taken college chemistry probably remembers that the simplest orbitals are spherical "s-orbitals" and that there are also more complicated shapes. In simple physical terms, an orbital is simply a place in an atom or molecule where an electron can live, and specifying the "address" of the electron actually determines
        all of its physical properties, such as its energy and angular momentum.</p>
    
    <p>As the laws of quantum mechanics were being discovered, physicists were able to figure out how to apply these laws to determine the orbitals of simple atoms like Hydrogen with pen and paper mathematics. However, in more complicated atoms and molecules, determining the orbitals
        can be a very complicated mathematical task, even though we know the physics. This explains why the discipline of molecular physics has always been so intertwined with computer science. The ability of computers to perform complicated mathematical calculations was incredibly beneficial
        to the task of determining orbitals, and molecular physicists and quantum chemists have been perfecting the process ever since.</p>
        
     <p>Today, molecular orbitals are not really an area of active research. There existence is assumed, as is the fact that their properties can be specified by a computer performing an appropriate algorithm, such as the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00268970701757875">Hartree-Fock method</a>. 
         Instead, researchers care about how electrons are transported between orbitals, and the interactions they experience when occupying orbitals. The situation is analogous to that of an astrophysicist interested in studying the velocity of a particular planet as it orbits the Sun. The existence of all the planets, moons, and the Sun is assumed,
         and it is taken for granted that others have already calculated basic properties like the mass, period of rotation, and angle of declination of these celestial bodies. Molecular physicists assume they are working with molecular orbitals just as astrophysicists assume they are working with round planets.

        <h3>Model Hamiltonians</h3></div>
    
    <p>To understand model Hamiltonians, it is first necessary to discuss undergraduate physics education and why it is the way it is. If you were interested in physics in high school, you probably discovered at some point that physicists know that the four "fundamental interactions" that govern all physical processes are the electromagnetic, strong nuclear, weak nuclear, and gravitational interactions.
    Therefore one might expect the undergraduate physics curriculum to look like "Intro to electromagnetism," "Intro to the strong nuclear interaction," etc. While we do learn electromagnetism as undergraduates, the other three interactions are rarely discussed. Instead, the standard physics curriculum consists of classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics.
    These courses teach us how to determine the physical behavior of systems (of point particles, quantum mechanical wavefunctions, and large collections of particles/wavefunctions, respectively) for a variety of possible physical interactions. In contrast, courses like electromagnetism are restricted to a specific interaction that happens to be present in our physical universe.
    This "restriction" might seem slight given that we are always in our universe, but in fact our universe actually looks very different depending on one's location and length scale. At human length scales, gravity dominates, the nuclear forces are negligible, and electromagnetism has subtle yet important consequences, e.g. through friction. 
    However, the "interaction" of friction looks very different than the fundamental theory of electromagnetism at the subatomic scale (quantum electrodynamics). Since the fundamental interactions can look so different in different systems, it is better to teach students how physical systems behave without specifying the exact interaction.</p>
    
    <p>This philosophy underlies an important methodology in molecular and condensed matter physics research, so-called model Hamiltonians. I will use a simple example from undergraduate quantum mechanics to illustrate this. Let's say that our system is a stationary spin-1/2 particle, i.e. the operator <i>S<sub>z</sub></i> representing the <it>z</it> component of its spin has eigenvalues <it>m</it> = &plusmn 1/2. 
    We can describe this system's interaction with a magnetic field <b>B</b><i> = B</i><b>z</b> applied along the <b>z</b> axis with the model Hamiltonian <i>H</i> = &#916<i>(B)S<sub>z</sub></i>. This equation states specifically that the property of the electron that couples to the magnetic field is <i>S<sub>z</sub></i>, as the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternâ€“Gerlach_experiment">Stern-Gerlach experiment</a> shows.
    However, the form of the coupling is represented generally by the function &#916<i>(B)</i>. This demonstrates that the model Hamiltonian approach is an efficient way of separating <i>what</i> is interacting, which is often known as a general consequence of the fundamental theory, from <i>how</i> it is interacting, which is specific to the system and length scale at hand.</p>
    
    <p>Returning to our simple example, in undergraduate quantum mechanics one learns that a stationary electron in a magnetic field applied along the <b>z</b> axis is described by the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeeman_effect">Zeeman Hamiltonian</a> <i>H = -&#956<sub>B</sub>gS<sub>z</sub>B/&#8463</i>. This specifies that in our model Hamiltonian, &#916<i>(B)</i> = <i>-&#956<sub>B</sub>gB/&#8463</i>. 
    In other words, it tells us two crucial things about how the electron spin interacts with the magnetic field: it is linear in the field strength <i>B</i>, and the constant of proportionality is <i>&#956<sub>B</sub>g/&#8463</i>. Here, the Bohr magneton <i>&#956<sub>B</sub></i> and reduced Planck's constant <i>&#8463</i> are fundamental constants, but <i>g</i>, the so-called g-factor, is not. 
    It turns out that the Zeeman hamiltonian is typically correct but the value of <i>g</i> depends on the system. Thus, the Zeeman Hamiltonian you learned can be thought of as a model Hamiltonian with the g-factor as the system specific parameter. Indeed, there is active research into realizing physical systems with fortuitous values of <i>g</i>, known as "g-factor engineering."</p>
    
    <p>My own research applies model Hamiltonians to better understand molecular magnets. Two fundamentally important features of a molecular magnet are the preference of the molecular spin to align with a specific axis, the so called "uniaxial magnetic anisotropy" <i>D</i>, and the preference of the molecular spin to align with other spins in the environment, the so called "exchange coupling" <i>J</i>.
        As a result, an illustrative model Hamiltonian is given by <i>H = &#931<sub>i</sub> D<sub>i</sub> (S<sub>i</sub><sup>z</sup>)<sup>2</sup> + &#931<sub>i,j</sub> J<sub>ij</sub> <b>S</b><sub>i</sub> <b>S</b><sub>j</sub></i> where the indices <i>i, j</i> run over the different molecular spins. <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01126">This paper</a> is a good investigation of this model Hamiltonian by some of my colleagues.
        On a daily basis what I typically do is write code to solve such a model Hamiltonian and investigate scattering from such a model Hamiltonian. This necessitates a familiarity with the mathematics of second quantized quantum chemistry, as well as computational tools which are necessary for larger systems. Luckily, a lot of computational tools for quantum chemistry have been developed as a part of the <a href = "https://pyscf.org/">PySCF package</a> which has proved invaluable to me.</p>
