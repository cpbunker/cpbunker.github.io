        <h3>Molecular Physics</h3></div>
        <div class="col-sm-8" style="padding:10px;font-size:18px;">
            <p>My theoretical training is in computational quantum chemistry, which leverages modern computing technology to describe the physics of many-electron quantum mechanical systems such as molecules.
            Molecules interest me because the sheer variety of possible molecules offers an incredible array of different functions. Furthermore, all this variety occurs in nanometer scale systems where quantization effects become important,
            making molecules attractive candidates for quantum technologies.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, I am doing research with the <a href ="https://efrc.ufl.edu">Center for Molecular Magnetic Quantum Materials</a> (M@QM) at UF. The main task of M2QM is to characterize the magnetic properties of molecules using computational quantum chemistry.
                Exciting work is also being done here that explores how machine learning can characterize molecules for a lower computational cost. Once the molecules are characterized, we investigate how to leverage their properties to store information.</p>

            <p>My particular interests lie at the intersection of molecule-based quantum technology and quantum computing, namely realizing <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.9b00984">molecular spin qubits</a> (MSQs). These would offer the opportunity to leverage quantum mechanics to store and process information extremely efficiently.
            However, there are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiVincenzo%27s_criteria">physical conditions</a> that must be achieved to use molecules in quantum computers. This requires continued investigation of the dynamics of molecular spins.
            I have written what I hope is an accessible introduction to this work <a href="https://cpbunker.github.io/ResearchAnatomy/">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing and quantum chemistry go hand in hand. Much effort, including my own current research, is going toward determining how chemical systems can host <a href = "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-019-0232-y">scalable quantum computation</a>. 
                However, my interest is more about how software will be developed on quantum computers as the hardware technology progresses, and how this software will transform many facets of scientific research.</p>

            One of the reasons the physics of quantum mechanical systems is such a fascinating field is that an amazing variety of behavior is possible. For example, there are millions of known molecules, each with different physical properties, and each of these can be tweaked in a multitude of ways, such as charge doping, ligand addition, or strain, leading to even more variety.
            Ever since the foundations of quantum mechanics were developed, physicists, chemists and materials scientists have been using this variety of behavior to find materials that are of great practical value to humanity, resulting in ubiquitous devices such as semiconductors and solar panels.

           This technology paradigm is especially relevant to my current work on molecular spin qubits. Viable quantum hardware really only exists with superconducting qubits, which are themselves still pretty bleeding edge. Molecular spin qubits are even less mature, so it is beneficial to look at all the work that's
            been done with superconducting qubits and see it as a roadmap in terms of the engineering challenges that need to be overcome. At the same time, we need to justify why this less mature technology might be better that the current state of the art in the future. 
            So the perspective of doing science as if you're comparing and contrasting commercial technologies is incredibly helpful.
