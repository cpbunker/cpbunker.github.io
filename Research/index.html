        <p>Many-electron quantum mechanical systems, which are the fundamental object of quantum chemistry, exhibit a variety of conceptually difficult physics. Surprisingly, however, quantum chemists have long known the way to calculate the exact ground state of any many electron system: <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_configuration_interaction">FCI</a>. 
            However, applying this method to all but the smallest systems is impossible with modern computing power. As a result, modern quantum chemistry is essentially a computing problem that consists of choosing and then applying the appropriate <a href = "https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2102.01171">wavefunction ansatz</a>.</p>
        
        <p>My current work is with the <a href ="https://efrc.ufl.edu">Center for Molecular Magnetic Quantum Materials</a> at UF. We use numerical quantum chemistry to study the magnetic properties of molecules. Together with experimental collaborators, we are pressing forward on how to design and control molecular qubits. </p>

<hr><h2 style="text-align:center; color: navy">Research Anatomy</h2><hr>

    <p>When applying to graduate school, I had my share of frustrating experiences looking at the websites of potential advisors which touted their research interests in technical jargon but did nothing to inform me what they actually did on a daily basis. To remedy this, I will now try to unpack what constitutes my research.</p>
    <p>To do this, it is first necessary to discuss undergraduate physics education and why it is the way it is. If you were interested in physics in high school, you probably discovered at some point that physicists know that the four "fundamental interactions" that govern all physical processes are the electromagnetic, strong nuclear, weak nuclear, and gravitational interactions.
    Therefore one might expect the undergraduate physics curriculum to look like "Intro to electromagnetism," "Intro to the strong nuclear interaction," etc. While we do learn electromagnetism in undergraduate, the other four interactions are rarely discussed. Instead, the bedrock the physics curriculum consists of (in my opinion) classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics.
    These courses teach us how to determine the physical behavior of systems (of point particles, quantum mechanical wavefunctions, and large collections of particles/wavefunctions, respectively) for a wide variety of interactions. In contrast, courses like electromagnetism are restricted to a specific interaction of our physical universe.
    
    This "restriction" might seem slight given that we are always in our universe, but in fact our universe actually looks very different depending on the location and length scale. At human scale, gravity dominates, the nuclear forces are negligible, and electromagnetism has subtle yet important consequences, e.g. through friction. 
    However, the "interaction" of friction looks very different than the fundamental theory of electromagnetism at the subatomic scale, which is quantum electrodynamics (QED). Since the fundamental interactions can look so different in different systems, it is better to teach students how physical systems behave without specifying the exact interaction.</p>
    
    <p>This philosophy underlies an important methodology in molecular and condensed matter physics research, namely "model" Hamiltonians. I will use a simple example from undergraduate quantum mechanics to illustrate this. Let's say that our system is a stationary spin-1/2 particle, i.e. the operator <i>S<sub>z</sub></i> representing the <it>z</it> component of its spin has eigenvalues <it>m</it> = &plusmn 1/2. 
    We can describe this system's interaction with a magnetic field <b>B</b><i> = B</i><b>z</b> applied along the <b>z</b> axis with the model Hamiltonian <i>H</i> = &#916<i>(B)S<sub>z</sub></i>.</p> This equation states specifically that the property of the electron that couples to the magnetic field is <i>S<sub>z</sub></i>, as the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternâ€“Gerlach_experiment">Stern-Gerlach experiment</a> shows.
    However, the form of the coupling is represented generally by the function &#916<i>(B)</i>. This demonstrates that the model Hamiltonian approach is an efficient way of separating <i>what</i> is interacting, which is often precisely known from fundamental physics, from <i>how</i> it is interacting, which is system specific.</p>
    
    <p>For example, in undergraduate quantum mechanics, you probably learned that the a stationary electron in a magnetic field applied along the <b>z</b> axis was described by the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeeman_effect">Zeeman Hamiltonian</a> <i>H = -&#956<sub>B</sub>gS<sub>z</sub>B/&#8463</i>. This specifies that &#916<i>(B)</i> = <i>-&#956<sub>B</sub>gB/&#8463</i>. 
    In other words, it tells us two crucial things about how the electron spin interacts with the magnetic field: it is linear in the field strength <i>B</i>, and the constant of proportionality is <i>&#956<sub>B</sub>g/&#8463</i>. Here, the Bohr magneton <i>&#956<sub>B</sub></i> and reduced Planck's constant <i>&#8463</i> are fundamental constants, but <i>g</g>, the so called g-factor, is not. 
    It turns out that form of the Zeeman hamiltonian is typically correct but the value of <i>g</i> depends on the system. Thus, the Zeeman Hamiltonian you learned can be thought of as a model Hamiltonian with the g-factor as the model parameter. Indeed, there is active research into realizing physical systems with a fortuitous value of <i>g</i>, known as "g-factor engineering".</p>
    
    <p>My own research applies model Hamiltonians to better understand molecular magnets. Two fundamentally important features of a molecular magnet are the preference of the molecular spin to align with a specific axis, the so called "uniaxial magnetic anisotropy" <i>D</i>, and the preference of the molecular spin to align with other spins in the environment, the so called "exchange coupling" <i>J</i>.
        As a result, an illustrative model Hamiltonian is given by <i>H = &#931<sub>i</sub> D<sub>i</sub> S<sub>i</sub><sup>z</sup> + &#931<sub>i,j</sub> J<sub>i,j</sub> <b>S</b><sub>i</sub> <b>S</b><sub>j</sub> where the indices <i>i, j</i> run over the different molecular spins. <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01126">This paper</a> is a good investigation of this model Hamiltonian by some of my colleagues.
