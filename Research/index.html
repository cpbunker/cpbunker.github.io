        <div style="padding:10px"><p>I spent Spring 2020 doing full time research for this condensed matter experiment group that focuses on topological materials. I was exposed to a variety of new research and methods. My first major project was to numerically calculate the zero dispersion energy levels of band gap inverted IV-VI quantum wells. This required directed reading on semiconductor heterostrocutres, the envelop function method and k.p perturbation theory, which came largely from <it> Wave Mechanics Applied to Semiconductor Heterostructures<it> by G. Bastard. I later extended the code to determine nonzero dispersion energies. During this time, I also collected XRD, Raman and FTIR data characterizing many samples of SrBiSe and CuBiSe thin films. My numerical results for the bound state energies of PbSnSe quantum wells were used in the paper "Weak antilocalization beyond the fully diffusive regime in Pb1-xSnxSe topological quantum wells." </p></div>

    <b>W Mass Group</b> Dr. Josh Bendavid, CMS, CERN.
        <p>The goal of my project at CERN was to reduce the error on data from simulated W decay events. Motivated by the theoretical angular cross section predicted by QCD, I wrote code divide millions of W decay events into subsets based on the W transverse momentum and pseudorapidity, and then calculate the angular smoothing coefficients <it>A<sub>0</sub>... A<sub>7</sub></it> for each subset. These coefficents were used to reweight the some of the data in order to better match the theoretical cross section. </p>
            
        <p>I finally analyzed the subsequent uncertainty on the parameters of the lepton produced in the decay to see if they were reduced by the smoothing  process. I presented this work at the Notre Dame 2019 Fall Undergraduate Research Fair, that poster is available here. </p>
        
    <b>Nanoscale Electronics and Optoelectronics Lab </b>Dr. Daniel Santavicca, Department of Physics, University of North Florida.
        <p>I was involved in Dr. Santavicca's project to design superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPD's). My role was to use AWR Design Environment software to design circuit element geometries. I would input unusual shapes, such as a circularly spiraling inductor, and the software would solve Maxwell's equations over all regions of the element to estimate its macroscopic electrical properties. I designed hundreds of different elements spanning parameter space in order to compare their properties and tune the SNSPD circuit to its desired behavior.
