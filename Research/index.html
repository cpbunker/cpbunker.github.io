        <h3>Molecular Physics</h3></div>
        <div class="col-sm-8" style="padding:10px;font-size:18px;">
            <p>My <a href="https://cpbunker.github.io/ResearchAnatomy/">training</a> is in computational molecular physics, which leverages modern computing technology to describe the physics of many-electron quantum mechanical systems such as molecules.
            There are millions of known molecules, each with different physical properties, and each of these can be tweaked in a multitude of ways, such as charge doping, ligand addition, or strain, leading to even more variety. 
            Furthermore, all this occurs in nanometer scale systems where quantization effects become important, making molecules attractive candidates for quantum technologies.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, I am doing research with the <a href ="https://efrc.ufl.edu">Center for Molecular Magnetic Quantum Materials</a> (M2QM) at UF. The main task of M2QM is to characterize the magnetic properties of molecules using computational molecular physics.
                Exciting work is also being done here that explores how machine learning can characterize molecules for a lower computational cost. Once the molecules are characterized, our objective is to leverage their magnetic properties to store information.</p>

            <p>My particular interests lie at the intersection of molecule-based quantum technology and quantum computing, namely the realization of <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.9b00984">molecular spin qubits</a> (MSQs). These offer the opportunity to leverage quantum mechanics to store and process information extremely efficiently.
            Such a realization is challenging because of the stringent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiVincenzo%27s_criteria">physical conditions</a> quantum computers must satisfy. As such, more theoretical work is needed to determine how well the MSQ candidates that have been experimentally proposed
            would operate in a real quantum computer, and that is where I come in. My <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15747">current project</a> explores what types of molecules are best suited for scattering based quantum entanglement.
            I have written what I hope is an accessible introduction to the nuts and bolts of this work <a href="https://cpbunker.github.io/ResearchAnatomy/">here</a>.</p>

            Throughout the 20th century, physicists, chemists and materials scientists have applied the laws of quantum mechanics to describe materials. This has led to ubiquitous devices such as semiconductors and solar panels.
            However, these devices are typically micrometer sized, whereas quantum mechanical effects only really dominate at nanometer scale. Recent experimental advances in our ability to construct systems at this miniscule length scale
            promises a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_scale_electronics">next generation of electronics</a> that is fundamentally quantum mechanical in nature.

            <p>The past two decades have seen intense research into how quantum mechanical systems can store and process information. However, existing quantum computers remain functionally limited, in large part due to their small number of information storage units (qubits).
                Molecular physics offers a new frontier of <a href = "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-019-0232-y">scalable hardware</a> for quantum computers.

                <p>What I enjoy most about working in quantum computing hardware is that we are developing technology, not just doing basic science.
                Superconducting qubits are the most viable quantum hardware out there right now, but have not yet matured, and other hardware such as MSQs are even less developed.
                However, we have the advantage of being able to look at the other technologies out there as a roadmap of the engineering challenges that need to be overcome. 
                At the same time, we need to justify how our less mature hardware could some day be better than the current state of the art. This requires taking a really discerning look at potential weaknesses of the other technologies.
                I find this mindset of doing science as if I'm comparing and contrasting commercial technologies to be incredibly rewarding.</p>
