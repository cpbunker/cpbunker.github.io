        <h4>Electronic band structure in semiconductors</h4></div>
        <div class="col-sm-8" style="padding:10px">
            <p>The physics of electrons in semiconductors is an exciting extension of quantum theory that has transformed our society. I have been exposed to this topic in my solid state physics course and through research. I am particularly interested in the band structure of low dimensional materials and computational models of these systems. I have already worked on determining the dispersion relation of topologically protected states using numerical matrix methods.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-8" style="padding:10px">
            <p>The natural world is full of incredible phenomena in which huge collections of organisms engage in complex, beautiful group behavior. There are many investigations of these behaviors at the intersection of physics computer science. Reynolds' <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/280811.281008">paper</a> discusses how a model of animals as individual "actors" with a few behavioral options that they choose from according to simple rules can produce realistic simulations of flocks and herds. However, the process of tuning the rules and behavior space to achieve realism is both nontrivial and intriguing.

            <p>I have a strong interest in chemistry for a physicist, and am particularly intrigued by quantum explanations of electron behavior in molecules, particularly bonding.

        <div class="col-sm-8" style="padding:10px">
            <p>I spent Spring 2020 doing full time research for this condensed matter experiment group that focuses on topological materials. I was exposed to a variety of new research and methods. My first major project was to numerically calculate the zero dispersion energy levels of band gap inverted IV-VI quantum wells. This required directed reading on semiconductor heterostructures, the envelop function method and k.p perturbation theory, which came largely from <i> Wave Mechanics Applied to Semiconductor Heterostructures</i> by G. Bastard. I then extended my code to determine nonzero dispersion energies, and culminated the project with this <a href="https://cpbunker.github.io/pdfs/AssafGroupQuantumWell.pdf">presentation</a> to my group. I later applied my code to calculating the bound state energies of PbSnSe quantum wells, which were used in the paper "Weak antilocalization beyond the fully diffusive regime in Pb1-xSnxSe topological quantum wells." </p>

        <div class="col-sm-8"><p>A collaborating group saw potential superconductivity in thin (10-50 nm) &#945-Sn films at low temperature, which we sought to investigate further. I performed magnetotransport measurements recording the longitudinal and Hall resistance of the samples through magnetic field sweeps of 0 to 16 T and temperature sweeps of 1.5 to 4 K. I made note of critical field, critical temperature, and critical current points where the resistance was observed to sharply drop. I also analyzed the resistance vs. field data for evidence of Shubnokov de Haas oscillations which had been previously <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12248">observed</a> in &#945-Sn. I summarized this work in the following <a href="https://cpbunker.github.io/pdfs/AssafGroupAlphaSn.pdf">presentation</a> to the group.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-8" style="padding:10px">
            <p>The goal of my project at CERN was to reduce the error on data from simulated W decay events. Motivated by the theoretical angular cross section predicted by QCD, I wrote code divide millions of W decay events into subsets based on the W transverse momentum and pseudorapidity, and then calculate the angular smoothing coefficients <i>A<sub>0</sub>... A<sub>7</sub></i> for each subset. These coefficents were used to reweight the some of the data in order to better match the theoretical cross section. </p>
            
            <p>I finally analyzed the subsequent uncertainty on the parameters of the lepton produced in the decay to see if they were reduced by the smoothing  process. I presented this work at the Notre Dame 2019 Fall Undergraduate Research Fair, that poster is available <a href="https://cpbunker.github.io/pdfs/WMass.pdf">here</a>. </p>

        <p>I was involved in Dr. Santavicca's project to design superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPD's). My role was to use AWR Design Environment software to design circuit element geometries. I would input unusual shapes, such as a circularly spiraling inductor, and the software would solve Maxwell's equations over all regions of the element to estimate its macroscopic electrical properties. I designed hundreds of different elements spanning parameter space in order to compare their properties and tune the SNSPD circuit to its desired behavior.
