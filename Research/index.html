        <h3>Quantum Chemistry</h3></div>
        <div class="col-sm-8" style="padding:10px;font-size:18px;">
        <p>Many-electron quantum mechanical systems, which are the fundamental subject of quantum chemistry, exhibit a variety of conceptually difficult physics. It may be surprising to learn that quantum chemists have long known the way to calculate the exact ground state of any many electron system: <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_configuration_interaction">FCI</a>. 
            However, applying this method to all but the smallest systems is impossible with modern computing power. As a result, modern quantum chemistry is essentially a computing problem that consists of choosing and then applying the appropriate <a href = "https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2102.01171">wavefunction ansatz</a> so that your limited computing power can be used to address the physical properties you are interested in.</p>
        
        <p>My current work is with the <a href ="https://efrc.ufl.edu">Center for Molecular Magnetic Quantum Materials</a> at UF. We use computational quantum chemistry tools to study the magnetic properties of molecules. Our goal is to overcome the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiVincenzo%27s_criteria">physical challenges</a> to implementing quantum computing devices using <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.9b009840>"molecular spin qubits</a>. 
        I have written what I hope is an accessible introduction to this current work <a href="https://cpbunker.github.io/ResearchAnatomy/">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing and quantum chemistry go hand in hand. Much effort, including my own current research, is going toward determining how chemical systems can host <a href = "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-019-0232-y">scalable quantum computation</a>. 
                However, my interest is more about how software will be developed on quantum computers as the hardware technology progresses, and how this software will transform many facets of scientific research.</p>

        <h3>Quantum Technologies</h3></div>
        <div class="col-sm-8" style="padding:10px;font-size:18px;">
        <p>
            One of the reasons the physics of quantum mechanical systems is such a fascinating field is that an amazing variety of behavior is possible. For example, there are millions of known molecules, each with different physical properties, and each of these can be tweaked in a multitude of ways, such as charge doping, ligand addition, or strain, leading to even more variety.
            Ever since the foundations of quantum mechanics were developed, physicists, chemists and materials scientists have been using this variety of behavior to find materials that are of great practical value to humanity, resulting in ubiquitous devices such as semiconductors and solar panels.
        </p><p>
            I find that this paradigm of developing useful technology is a great way of doing science. This consists of having a practical device in mind and researching with regards to the technical challenges that obstruct physically implementing the device. This practice is essentially rewarding because while theoretical physicists often spend an entire career on a narrow problem,
            usable technology always demands knowledge of multiple areas. Quantum computing is a great example of this, combining quantum physics and computer science.
