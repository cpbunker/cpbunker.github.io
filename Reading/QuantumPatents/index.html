        <h4><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3554925">Quantum Patents</a></h4>
        <p>My fiancée is in law school, and my interest in physics and the technology breakthroughs that it drives extends to intellectual property law. Quantum computing is a rapidly emerging tech area that also aligns with my area of specialization in physics, so naturally I am interested in research breakthroughs and how they make their way into the courtroom.</p>
        
        <p>Put simply, quantum computing takes advantage of the properties of a quantum state, such as superposition, to better process and store information. As a naive observer, it seems to me that the physics of quantum states is not patentable. What I read here supports this stance, since "Patent claims generally define devices, structures, or methods." In quantum computing, these methods pertain to manipulating qubits, examples being "Method and system for decomposing single- qubit quantum circuits into a discrete basis," and "Method and system that implement a V-gate quantum circuit," two patents owned by Microsoft.</p>
        
        <p>It seems that a major dividing line between fundamental physics and patentable technology is drawn by the patent criterion of "obviousness."</p>
            <blockquote>According to the Patent Act’s Section §103, a patent claim is invalid “if the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art are such that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious ... to a person having ordinary skill in the art”.</blockquote>
        <p>As a result, quantum mechanical applications which are obvious to the physicist are not patentable. As the author points out, this implies that those writing and assessing the patent must know
        <blockquote>(1) the patent’s technology; (2) the state-of-the-art in the technologies field; and (3) the differences between the two.</blockquote>
        Thus although the basic precepts of quantum mechanics are not patentable, understanding them is required to approach such patents.
        
        
            
        
        while for the latter there is "Probabilistic inference in machine learning using a quantum oracle," and "Quantum-assisted training of neural networks."
