<h1 style="text-align:center"> About Me </h1>
    <p style="text-align:center; font-family:Arial"> I am a graduate student in the Physics department of the University of Florida. I am interested in computational physics and statistical mechanics, with a focus on how these approaches can be used to investigate complex quantum mechanical and biophysical systems. I enjoy studying how physical models and how they can be made to bridge theoretical insights and observed behaviors. </p>
