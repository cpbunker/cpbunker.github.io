<h1> About Me <h1>
    <p> I am a graduate student in the Physics department of the University of Florida. I am interested in computational physics and statistical mechanics, with a focus on how these approaches can be used to investigate complex quantum mechanical and biophysical systems. I enjoy studying how physical models and how they can be made to bridge theoretical insights and observed behaviors.
